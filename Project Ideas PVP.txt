By 50 Years from 2022, the demand for food will surge 70%,
in line with rapid population growth.
A UN study found that about 9.9% of the worldâ€™s population still goes hungry, 
so the thought of feeding almost 10 billion mouths is a daunting prospect. 
With environmental changes hard to predict, 
we must turn to innovation in agriculture technology.
